📘 Introduction to Kubernetes
Linux Foundation Course Notes
📌 Introduction

Container images allow us to package:

Application code

Runtime

Libraries

Dependencies

into a pre-defined format.

Container runtimes such as:

runC

containerd

CRI-O

use these images to create and run containers.

While these runtimes can run containers on a single host, production environments require:

Fault tolerance

Scalability

High availability

To achieve this, we use a container orchestrator, which acts as a centralized controller managing multiple connected hosts as a cluster.

📦 What Are Containers?

Containers are an application-centric method to deliver:

High-performing applications

Scalable applications

Portable applications

They provide:

Isolated environments

Lightweight virtualization

No interference between applications

Containers are especially suitable for microservices architecture, where applications are split into smaller independent services.

🎯 What Is Container Orchestration?

Running containers on a single machine may work in:

Development (Dev)

Testing environments

However, in:

Quality Assurance (QA)

Production (Prod)

Applications must meet strict requirements:

✅ Fault-tolerance

✅ On-demand scalability

✅ Optimal resource usage

✅ Service auto-discovery

✅ External accessibility

✅ Zero-downtime updates & rollbacks

Container orchestration tools automate deployment, scaling, networking, and management of containers across clusters.

🏗️ Container Orchestrators

With enterprises moving to the cloud, container orchestration solutions have become essential.

Some popular container orchestration tools include:

1️⃣ Amazon Elastic Container Service

Hosted container orchestration service by AWS.

2️⃣ Azure Container Instances

Basic container orchestration service by Microsoft Azure.

3️⃣ Azure Service Fabric

Open-source orchestrator by Microsoft Azure.

4️⃣ Kubernetes

Open-source orchestration tool originally started by Google and now part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

5️⃣ Nomad

Container and workload orchestrator by HashiCorp.

6️⃣ Docker Swarm

Built-in container orchestrator within Docker Engine.

🚀 Why Use Container Orchestrators?

Managing a few containers manually is possible.

Managing hundreds or thousands across global infrastructure?
Nearly impossible without orchestration.

Container orchestrators provide:

🔹 Cluster Management

Group multiple hosts into a single cluster.

🔹 Intelligent Scheduling

Automatically place containers based on available resources.

🔹 Service Communication

Allow containers to communicate regardless of host location.

🔹 Storage Binding

Attach containers to persistent storage.

🔹 Load Balancing

Expose applications using abstraction layers.

🔹 Resource Optimization

Monitor and optimize CPU and memory usage.

🔹 Security Policies

Implement access control and security rules.
